# EthernetStreamSDKGUI
EthernetStreamSDKGUI was developed to demonstrate possible usage of this EthernetStreamSDK.
Project is fully open source, therefore you can access all source files, which can serve as
an example for developing your own application. Note that the most important part of this project is ”ControllerCore” class (with its dependencies like Thread classes and NetworkClient class), which demonstrates basic usage of SDK, other files are platform dependent and may not be so interesting.
